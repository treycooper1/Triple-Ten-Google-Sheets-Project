# Triple-Ten-Google-Sheets-Project
# ðŸ“Š User Retention & Conversion Funnel Analysis

This project analyzes customer behavior through **conversion funnels**, **retention rates**, and **cohort analysis**, based on raw user data. It is designed to help businesses understand how users engage with their platform over timeâ€”identifying drop-off points, patterns in purchasing behavior, and opportunities for retention improvement.

## ðŸ§¾ Project Overview

This Google Sheets project includes multiple tabs that break down the user journey from initial engagement to repeat purchasing. Using pivot tables, data transformations, and cohort tracking, we uncover insights into user retention and conversion effectiveness.
